* Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD provide non-random variance because their p values are above the significance level of 0.05.
* The p value is 5.35x10^-11 and, therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
* With an R-squared value = 0.6825, our data fits the linear regression by approximately 68%.

* According to my PSI box plot, the presure levels do not vary by more than 100 PSI. In fact, the maximum variance is 62 PSI from the mean (1498.78 PSI). Therefore, the current manufacturing data meets the design specifications for all manufacturing lots in total and for each lot individually.
