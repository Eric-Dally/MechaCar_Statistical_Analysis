Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Vehicle wieght, spoiler angle, and AWD provide non-random variance because their p values are above the significance level of 0.05.


Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
* the p value is 5.35x10^-11 and, therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
* With an R-squared value = 0.6825, our data fits the linear regression by approximately 68%.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
